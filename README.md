#Arcade Game Project

Welcome to the Arcade Game, a browser-based game that'll test your motor skills in the most elementary way possible. Ever play leap frog? Yeah. 

_This project was done as a requirement for [Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001)._

## Play
Download the files into a local directory and open the `index.html` in a web browser of your choice.

You will be presented with a cute grid in the center of your screen. At the bottom is a boy character (you), and at the top are some bugs scuttling across the screen. The bugs are your enemy. Similar to Pac-Man, avoid crashing into them. Otherwise you "die" and respawn at the starting point. Make it to the water without touching the bugs? Congrats! You won. Repaly to your heart's content. 

**How to Move**
Using your Up, Down, Right, and Left arrow keys on your keyboard, you can move your character all around the grid (except for the water). You cannot move off the board. Sorry.
